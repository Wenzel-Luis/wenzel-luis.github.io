Welcome to my website! I am currently a second-year master's student in Computer Science at [WashU](https://washu.edu/), and am grateful to become a member of [MVRL](https://mvrl.cse.wustl.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Nathan Jacobs](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Nathan-Jacobs.html). I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Eshed Ohn-Bar](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/ohn-bar-eshed/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). Previously, I received my BEng from [Qingdao University](https://www.qdu.edu.cn/).

I am intrigued by cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including computational photography, 3D spatiotemporal visual perception, multimodal language models, and generative models. I pursue both theoretical and practical innovations, valuing simplicity, efficiency, and scalability in impactful research.

[Prof. Jeremy Howard](https://jeremy.fast.ai/) is my philosophical mentor, and my ultimate dream is to establish a nonprofit organization akin to [Fast.ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast.ai). Before reaching that goal, the most practical way for me now is to help others as much as possible. If you have any questions or potential collaborations in mind, please feel free to reach out!

Aside from research, I have a few personal interestsâ€”literature, photography. You can find some of my photos tucked away in a quiet corner of this website. :)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
